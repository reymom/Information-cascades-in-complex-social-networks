# Information-cascades-in-complex-social-networks
My first project involving theory of complex systems, back in 2016, where I modeled the spreading of information through a Integrate-and-Fire-like system (as in neurons spiking dynamics) that allows us to reproduce experimental data obtained from Twitter, where it is easy to find the two regimes (calm stage and turbulent one showing large cascades for the propagation of certain tweets) and the phase transition separating them. I do other kinds of analysis using theory of Complex Systems, as I analyze the role of the nodes in the spreading phenomena.

## Material
The programs (.py) for doing the simulation and extract the results for the dynamics, including the phase-state.

The article where I explain in detail (but I little bit briefly, as the maximum lenght of the paper for the subject was 5 pages).
Here you can find all references and understand what I did and its applications to real social networks.
